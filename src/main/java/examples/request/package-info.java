/**
 * Provides examples of using blindsend in the <i>request</i> use case. In this use case, file Receiver
 * initiates file exchange by generating file exchange link via blindsend and transmitting it to file Sender. File Sender
 * uses the link to encrypt and send the file to blindsend, after which file Receiver can use the same link to receive and
 * decrypt the file.
 * <p>
 * Read more about blindsend and how the two use cases work at
 * <a href="https://developer.blindnet.io/blindsend/">blindsend documentation pages</a>.
